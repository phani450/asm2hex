# ASM2HEX


Source code of ASM2HEX front end. This tool is used in microprocessor lab to converts x86 ASM file to HEX file. This hex file can be dumped into microprocessor kits. 


To compile and convert *.asm file to .bin file, [FLAT Assembler (FASM)](http://flatassembler.net/) is used. As the microprocessor kits need .hex file, [Bin2hex](http://www.ht-lab.com/freeutils/bin2hex/bin2hex.html) tool is used to convert bin file to hex file.
